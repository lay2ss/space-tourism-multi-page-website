# ðŸš€ Space Tourism Multi-Page Website

This project is part of a *Frontend Mentor challenge, where I built a* **multi-page space tourism website**. The challenge focused on implementing a fully responsive website with multiple pages, structured design elements, and dynamic content.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The main goal of the challenge was to *replicate a high-fidelity design* using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It required implementing *dynamic navigation, page transitions, and responsive layouts* while maintaining accessibility and best practices.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- *HTML* â€“ Structuring the content
- *React* â€“ First experience using React for component-based development
- *SASS* â€“ Styling with better maintainability and nesting capabilities
- *Vite* â€“ Project bundling and fast development environment

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
This project marked my *first experience with React and SASS*. I learned:
- How to *create reusable components* in React
- Managing *useState and useEffect* effectively
- Handling *routing* for a multi-page experience
- Using *SCSS variables, mixins, and nesting* for cleaner styles
- Understanding *Vite's fast and optimized build process*
